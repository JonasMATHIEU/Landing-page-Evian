    <h2>Evian Product : Standard Range</h2>
    <p>As adults, our body consists of about 60% water. It is essential to maintain this balance because water is an essential element for its proper functioning. A hydrated body thus ensures normal physical and cognitive functions*.

There are many options for drinks. But water is one of the best sources of hydration possible. And with Evian natural mineral water, nature offers us an ideal hydration: pure water and 100% natural**.

At evian we firmly believe that it is important to accompany you to develop healthier hydration habits, that is, drink enough water every day. This water intake is made by what we drink (80% of the water we consume comes from what we drink) and our diet (20% of the water we consume comes from what we eat).

The European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) has established guidelines on the amount of water to be consumed daily according to age, sex, pregnancy or breastfeeding.</p>
